As you may be able to tell from the photos, these don't quite fit me, I wear a 10.5-11 (EUR42), however these are size 10 (EUR41), but nabbed these from a past online listing (depop) just due to how they look and was hoping there would be a chance they could fit, unfortunately they did not. So as a result these pretty much sat in my closet being a shelf queen and now I am deciding to part ways with them.

They are very gorgeous, very eye catching, and wish I could wear them out, but my toes are essentially crushed in the front and poke out too much through the peephole, so uncomfortable to attempt to walk in.

Selling for what I paid, they are in like-new condition, no box, and doubt are genuine due to price I paid, regardless looks amazing. Just don't make the same mistake I did and check your foot/shoe size (The shoe's sole is approx 10.25in or 26cm long, so just make sure your foot is smaller than that, my foot is ~27cm held in a heel shape (not flat))
